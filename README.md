# BouncySnowballWars
Game for Hackerspace Game Jam, Spring 2019

A local multiplayer snowball fight game for two players. 

# How to play
Connect one or two controllers. Upon starting the game, you will be asked to select input devices 
for player 1 or 2. One player can use keyboard and mouse, and one player will use a controller. Most 
controllers should be supported as long as they have two analog sticks and two shoulder buttons. 

After selecting input devices for both players, you will be taken to the game itself. The goal of 
the game is to hit the other player with your snowballs. You can build walls to protect yourself, 
but they will be destroyed upon being hit by three snowballs. 
To throw snowballs or build obstacles, you need snow. Snow can be collected from powerups, or 
picked up from the ground.
